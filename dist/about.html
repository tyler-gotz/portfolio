                <p>I am a hardworking, loyal, self-motivated Developer who brings knowledge from around the world. It is impossible to judge personality, workmanship, and competence by this website.
                    How do I make myself stand out from other applicants?  My experience traveling to 10 other countries is a start; along with a summer internship spent building apps for the Ho-Chunk Nation,
                    which broadened my knowledge of programming and the importance of teamwork.  Also, my time with Dodl.es and TESCHGlobal has helped me get my foot in the door and start my development career.</p>
